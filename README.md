# Feature-Extraction-and-Classification
Different methods of feature extraction have performed and the results of classification methods on the extracted features have been evaluated.  
The following methods have been implemented:  
1. Principal Component Analysis  
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis  
3. Regularized Discriminant Analysis
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Decision Trees  

The results can be found [here](https://github.com/shubhangighosh/Feature-Extraction-and-Classification/blob/master/Results.pdf)
